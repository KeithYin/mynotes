# Matching feature points



## Nearest-neighbor matching to feature database



*  Better: hypotheses are generated by *approximate nearest neighbor* matching of each feature to vectors in the database
  * SIFT uses best-bin-first modification to k-d tree algorithm
  * Use heap data structure to identify bins in order by their distance from query point
* Result: Can give speedup by factor of 100-1000 while finding nearest neighbor (of interest) 95% of the time



## Wavelet-based hashing



* compute a short (3-vector) descriptor from the neighborhood using a Haar "wavelet"
