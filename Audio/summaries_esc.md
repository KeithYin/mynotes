**Unsupervised Filterbank Learning Using Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Environmental Sound Classification**

> we propose to use Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ConvRBM) to learn filterbank from the raw audio signals.

> ConvRBM is a generative model trained in an unsupervised way to model the audio signals of arbitrary lengths. ConvRBM is trained using annealed dropout technique and parameters are optimized using Adam optimization.





**Audio Event and Scene Recognition: A Unified Approach using Strongly and Weakly Labeled Data**

> In this paper we propose a novel learning framework called **Supervised and Weakly Supervised Learning** where the goal is to learn simultaneously from weakly and strongly labeled data
