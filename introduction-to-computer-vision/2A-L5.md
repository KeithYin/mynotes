# Edges in image (Edge detection)

## how to detect change

**Derivatives and edges**

**edges correspond to extrema of derivatives**

## Differential Operators

* Differential Operators - when applied to the image returns some derivatives.
* Model these "Operators" as masks/kernels that compute the image gradient function
* Threshold the this gradient function to select the edge pixels.

## Image Gradient

gradient points : [delta f / delta x, delta f / delta y]

* The gradient points in the direction of most rapid increase in intensity.

## Discrete Gradient

## Operators

* Sobel
* Prewitt
* Roberts

using `fspecial('sobel')` in matlab to create this operators.

`imfilter()` 默认使用 `correlation`
