## Local Features

* Goal : Find points in an image that can be :
  * Found in other images
  * Found precisely-well localized
  * Found reliably-well matched

## Matching with Features

* Detect features (feature points) in both images
* Match features - find corresponding pairs
* Use these pairs to align images

* Problem1:
  * Detect the same point independently in both. Hard to do(不同的图片中检测出相同的点)
  * We need a repeatable detector

* Problem2:
  * For each point correctly recognize the corresponding one. (不同图片中找到特征点要匹配上)
  * We need a reliable and distinctive *descriptor* (description of each features)

## More motivation...

* Feature points are used also for:
  * Image alignment
  * 3D reconstruction
  * Motion tracking
  * Object recognition
  * Indexing and database retrieval
  * Robot navigation
  * ... other

## Characteritics of good features

* Recpeatability/Precision
  * The same feature can be found in several images despite geometric and photometric transformations

* Saliency/Matchability
  * Each feature has a distinctive description

* Compactness and efficiency
  * Many fewer features than image pixels

* Locality
  * A fearure occupies a relatively small area of the image; robust to clutter and occlusion.

## Corner Detection

**Gradient that have more than one direction!**

### Harris Corners

1. Compute Gaussian derivatives at each pixel
2. Compute second order moment matrix M in a Gaussian window
3. Compute corner response function R
4. Threshold R
5. Find local maxima of response function (non maximum supperssion)

### Properties of Harris Detector

* Rotation invariance
* Mostly invariant to additive and multiplicative intensity changes (threshold issue for multiplicative)
  * Only derivatives are used.
* image scale: Not invariant.
  * How to get scale invariant?

### Key point localization

* General idea: find robust extremum (maximum or minimum) both in space and in scale.
* SIFT: Scale invariance Feature Transform
* Scale space
* Laplacian ??????????
