# 机器学习中的几个问题解释

## co-adaptation

* 论文`Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaption of feature detectos` 有一句说明
  * This prevents complex `co-adaption` in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors.
  * When you build a neural network with certain number of neurons in its hidden layers, you ideally want each neuron to operate as an independent feature detector. If two or more neurons begin to detect the same feature repeatedly (co-adaptation), the network isn't utilising its full capacity efficiently. It's wasting computational resources computing the activation for redundant neurons that are all doing the same thing.  来自 [quora](https://www.quora.com/What-does-co-adaptation-of-neurons-in-a-Neural-network-mean)
  * 我的疑问是，`co-adaption` 问题出在 层内，还是层间。？？？？或者都会有。

## Sparse Deep Neural Network

* 概念来自 `Going Deeper with Convolutions` 
* 文中提到了一段话
  * if the probability distribution of the dataset is representable by a large, vary sparse deep neural network, then the optimal network topology can be constructed layer after layer by analyzing the correlation statistics of the preceding layer activations and clustering neurons with highly correlated outputs.
  * 首先，第一句 `the probability distribution of the dataset is representable by a large, vary sparse deep neural network` 应该怎么理解
  * [https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/03/21/convolution-neural-nets-part-2/](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/03/21/convolution-neural-nets-part-2/)
* `filter bank` 增加`filter`的个数，相当于增加 `feature`的数量。



## sparse

* 数据稀疏
* 特征稀疏
* 网络稀疏

**1.1 - Sparse**

Data is normally stored in sparse form. If no value exists for a given combination of dimension values, no row exists in the fact table. For example, if not every product is sold in every market. In this case, Market and Product are sparse dimensions.

It's why in the reporting tool [Obiee](https://gerardnico.com/wiki/dat/obiee/start) for instance, by default, [data are considered sparse](https://gerardnico.com/wiki/dat/obiee/obis/dense).

**1.2 - Dense**

Most multidimensional databases may also contain dense dimensions. A [fact table](https://gerardnico.com/wiki/olap/dimensional_modeling/fact_table) is considered to have dense data if it has (of a high probability to have) one row for every combination of its associated [dimension](https://gerardnico.com/wiki/olap/dimensional_modeling/dimension) levels.
