# Imitation Learning



**Learning to perform a task from expert demonstrations**

**两种思路**

* **behavioral cloning:** learns a policy as a supervised learning problem.
* **inverse reinforcement learning:** find the cost function under which the expert is uniquely optimal.




> We propose a new general framework for **directly extracting a policy from data** as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning.
